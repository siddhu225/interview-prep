### 🧱 What is an ORM?

**ORM** stands for **Object-Relational Mapping**. It's a programming technique (or a library/tool) that lets you **interact with a database using objects** instead of writing raw queries.

---

### 🔄 Key Idea of ORM

Instead of doing this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

You can do this in code:

```js
const user = await User.findByPk(1);  // Sequelize (SQL ORM)
```

ORMs:

* Map **database tables** → to **classes**
* Map **rows** → to **objects**
* Allow you to **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** using code
* Handle **relationships** (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many)
* Abstract away raw SQL/queries

### 🍃 Is **Mongoose** an ORM?

**Mongoose is NOT an ORM**, because it's not used for **relational databases** like SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Instead, **Mongoose is an ODM**.

---

### 🧬 What is ODM?

**ODM** = **Object Document Mapper**

Used with **NoSQL document-based databases** like **MongoDB**.

| Concept       | SQL (Relational) | MongoDB (Document-based) |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Mapping type  | ORM              | ODM                      |
| Table         | Collection       | Collection               |
| Row           | Record           | Document (JSON-like)     |
| Column        | Field            | Field                    |
| Relationships | Foreign Keys     | Embedded Docs / Refs     |

### ✅ Mongoose = ODM for MongoDB

Mongoose provides:

* Schema-based modeling
* CRUD abstraction over native MongoDB driver
* Middleware hooks (`pre`, `post`)
* Validation, indexing, plugins
* Population (like SQL JOINs)

#### Example:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create user
await User.create({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });

// Read user
const user = await User.findOne({ email: 'john@example.com' });
```

### ✅ Summary

| Concept | Mongoose          | Sequelize             | TypeORM       |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Type    | ODM               | ORM                   | ORM           |
| DB      | MongoDB           | SQL (MySQL, Postgres) | SQL           |
| Mapping | Schema → Document | Class → Table         | Class → Table |

Let me know if you want a quick comparison of **Mongoose vs native MongoDB driver**, or how to use an ORM like **Prisma** with SQL databases.

Yes, **MongoDB supports ACID compliance**, but with **important context and scope**.

---

## 🔐 What is ACID?

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable database transactions:

* **A**tomicity – All steps succeed or none.
* **C**onsistency – Transitions from one valid state to another.
* **I**solation – Concurrent transactions don’t interfere.
* **D**urability – Once committed, changes are permanent.

---

## 🍃 MongoDB and ACID

### ✅ Before v4.0:

MongoDB was **not fully ACID-compliant**. Only **single-document operations** were atomic and isolated.

### ✅ From v4.0+:

MongoDB **introduced multi-document transactions**, making it **ACID-compliant at the document and transaction level**, similar to relational databases.

## 🔍 Transaction Support in MongoDB

| Level                                  | ACID Support                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Single document**                    | ✅ Fully ACID-compliant (since always) |
| **Multi-document, single replica set** | ✅ From **v4.0**                       |
| **Multi-document, sharded cluster**    | ✅ From **v4.2**                       |

---

## ✍️ Example: Multi-document Transaction

```js
const session = await mongoose.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
  await User.updateOne({ _id: userId }, { $inc: { balance: -100 } }).session(session);
  await Bank.updateOne({ _id: bankId }, { $inc: { balance: 100 } }).session(session);

  await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  await session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```

This ensures **both operations succeed or both fail** — fulfilling atomicity.

## 🧩 Key Considerations

| Feature                  | MongoDB                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-document atomicity | ✅ Yes, with transactions                                   |
| Isolation                | ✅ Serializable-level isolation in transactions             |
| Overhead                 | 🚨 More latency and memory in high-volume workloads        |
| Default behavior         | Single-document atomicity (no explicit transaction needed) |

---

## ✅ Summary

| Property    | MongoDB Status                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atomicity   | ✅ Yes                                                     |
| Consistency | ✅ Yes                                                     |
| Isolation   | ✅ Yes                                                     |
| Durability  | ✅ Yes                                                     |
| Full ACID   | ✅ From MongoDB **4.0+** (replica set), **4.2+** (sharded) |

> MongoDB is **fully ACID-compliant** for **transactions** when used properly, especially with the newer versions.
