### **1. What is Express.js?**

**Express.js** is a lightweight, fast, and flexible web application framework built on top of Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web servers, APIs, and handling HTTP requests and responses. Express provides a set of robust tools for routing, middleware support, and templates to manage the lifecycle of requests from the client to the server. It is widely used to build RESTful APIs and web applications.

**Purpose**:

* **Routing**: Express simplifies defining routes (URLs) and handling HTTP methods (like GET, POST).
* **Middleware**: Helps add functionality like logging, authentication, and parsing requests.
* **Template Engines**: Provides easy integration with engines like EJS, Pug for rendering dynamic views.
* **Error Handling**: Express helps in catching and handling errors effectively in apps.

### **2. How do you create an Express app?**

To create a simple Express application, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Express**:
   First, initialize a Node.js project and install Express.

   ```bash
   npm init -y         # Initialize a Node.js project
   npm install express # Install Express.js
   ```

2. **Create an App**:
   After installing Express, create a file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`) and write the following basic code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Define a simple route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   // Set the app to listen on port 3000
   app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
   });
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   * `express()` creates an instance of an Express app.
   * `app.get('/', ...)` defines a route for the root URL that responds with "Hello World!".
   * `app.listen(3000)` starts the server on port 3000.

3. **Run the app**:
   To start the app, run the command:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

4. **Test**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the response.

---

### **3. What are middlewares in Express.js?**

**Middleware** in Express.js are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next()` function that allows you to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

**Purpose**:

* Middlewares are used for logging, authentication, error handling, request parsing, etc.
* They can modify the request or response, or terminate the request-response cycle.

**Common Examples**:

1. **Logging Middleware**: Logs every incoming request.

   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
       console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
       next();
   });
   ```

2. **Body Parsing Middleware**: Used to parse JSON or URL-encoded bodies.

   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json()); // for parsing application/json
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   ```

3. **Authentication Middleware**: Validates whether a user is logged in.

   ```javascript
   function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
       if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
           return next();
       } else {
           res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling Middleware**: Catches errors and sends an error response.

   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
       res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
   });
   ```

---

### **4. What is the role of the `next()` function in middleware?**

The `next()` function in Express middleware is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If you don't call `next()`, the request will be stuck and not proceed to the next step.

**Why it's necessary**:

* **Middleware chaining**: Without `next()`, the request would end there, and subsequent middleware or route handlers would not be executed.
* **Error handling**: You can pass control to an error handler if something goes wrong.

**Example**:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
   console.log('Middleware 1');
   next(); // Pass to the next middleware or route handler
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
   console.log('Middleware 2');
   res.send('Hello World'); // Response ends here, so `next()` is not called
});
```

If `next()` is not called in `Middleware 2`, the request cycle will stop and no further middleware or route handlers will run.

---

### **5. Explain the difference between `app.get()`, `app.post()`, and other HTTP methods in Express.**

In Express, these are route handlers that define how to respond to different types of HTTP requests:

1. **`app.get()`**:

   * Handles **GET** requests (used to retrieve data from the server).
   * Commonly used for displaying pages or fetching resources.

   ```javascript
   app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Welcome to the Home Page');
   });
   ```

2. **`app.post()`**:

   * Handles **POST** requests (used to submit data to the server, like creating or updating resources).
   * Common for form submissions and API requests.

   ```javascript
   app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Form submitted');
   });
   ```

3. **`app.put()`**:

   * Handles **PUT** requests (used to update existing resources).

   ```javascript
   app.put('/update', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Resource updated');
   });
   ```

4. **`app.delete()`**:

   * Handles **DELETE** requests (used to remove resources).

   ```javascript
   app.delete('/delete', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Resource deleted');
   });
   ```

5. **`app.all()`**:

   * Handles all HTTP methods for a specific route.

   ```javascript
   app.all('/any', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Handled any request method');
   });
   ```

Each of these methods defines the type of HTTP request your route will handle. For example, `app.get()` will only respond to GET requests, while `app.post()` responds to POST requests.


### **6. How does Express handle routing? What are route parameters and query strings? How do you handle them?**

**Routing in Express** refers to defining application endpoints (URIs) and how they respond to HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

```js
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

* **Route Parameters**: Dynamic values in the URL path, e.g., `/user/:id`. Accessed using `req.params`.
* **Query Strings**: Key-value pairs after `?` in the URL, e.g., `/user?id=123`. Accessed using `req.query`.

Example:

```js
// URL: /user/123?active=true
req.params.id      // '123'
req.query.active   // 'true'
```

---

### **7. What is `req` and `res` in Express.js?**

* **`req` (Request Object)**: Contains data sent by the client like headers, body, query, params, etc.
* **`res` (Response Object)**: Used to send a response back to the client.

Example:

```js
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  res.status(200).send(`Hello, ${name}`);
});
```

---

### **8. How would you handle errors in an Express.js application?**

Use **error-handling middleware** in Express. It has four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)`.

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong!' });
});
```

You can also catch synchronous and asynchronous errors using:

```js
try {
  // some code
} catch (err) {
  next(err);
}
```

Or use a wrapper for async routes to auto-handle errors.

---

### **9. What is `express.Router()` and how is it used?**

`express.Router()` is a mini Express app used to modularize and manage routes in different files.

Example:

**routes/user.js**

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```

**In app.js:**

```js
const userRoutes = require('./routes/user');
app.use('/user', userRoutes);
```

This keeps route logic clean and separated.

---

### **10. How do you handle static files in Express?**

Use the `express.static()` middleware to serve static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

Example:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

If your `public/` folder contains `styles.css`, it will be served at:

```
http://localhost:3000/styles.css
```

You can also mount it under a path:

```js
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
```

Then access: `http://localhost:3000/static/styles.css`



### **Question: Can you list all the HTTP Status Codes along with their uses and provide examples?**

### **1xx: Informational**

These codes indicate that the request has been received and the process is continuing.

* **100 Continue**
  **Use**: The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body (used in some large file uploads).
  **Example**: During a large file upload, the client sends a request, and the server responds with `100 Continue` to indicate the client can proceed with sending the body.

* **101 Switching Protocols**
  **Use**: The server is switching protocols, as requested by the client (e.g., switching from HTTP/1.1 to WebSockets).
  **Example**: A client requests an upgrade to a different protocol (like WebSockets), and the server responds with `101 Switching Protocols`.

---

### **2xx: Success**

These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed.

* **200 OK**
  **Use**: The request was successful, and the server is sending the response (used for GET requests).
  **Example**: When a client accesses a homepage, the server responds with `200 OK` and the HTML content of the homepage.

* **201 Created**
  **Use**: The request was successful and led to the creation of a new resource (commonly used with POST requests).
  **Example**: After a user submits a registration form, the server responds with `201 Created`, indicating the user has been added to the database.

* **202 Accepted**
  **Use**: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete (used for asynchronous processing).
  **Example**: A client submits a job to a server for processing (e.g., video encoding), and the server responds with `202 Accepted` while the job continues to process.

* **204 No Content**
  **Use**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (commonly used with DELETE requests).
  **Example**: A client sends a DELETE request to remove a resource, and the server responds with `204 No Content` to confirm the deletion.

* **205 Reset Content**
  **Use**: The server successfully processed the request, and the client should reset the document view (e.g., after form submission).
  **Example**: After submitting a form, the server responds with `205 Reset Content`, instructing the client to reset the form.

* **206 Partial Content**
  **Use**: The server is delivering only part of the resource, often used for partial file downloads.
  **Example**: A client requests only a range of bytes from a large file (e.g., downloading a part of a video), and the server responds with `206 Partial Content`.

---

### **3xx: Redirection**

These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, usually involving redirection.

* **300 Multiple Choices**
  **Use**: The server provides a list of options to the client for how to proceed.
  **Example**: A search results page might provide multiple different categories to filter the results.

* **301 Moved Permanently**
  **Use**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. All future requests should use the new URL.
  **Example**: A website has permanently moved from `http://oldsite.com` to `http://newsite.com`. The server responds with `301 Moved Permanently`.

* **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)**
  **Use**: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL. The client should continue using the original URL for future requests.
  **Example**: A web application temporarily redirects users to a maintenance page and responds with `302 Found`.

* **303 See Other**
  **Use**: The client should use a GET request to access a different URL, typically after a POST request.
  **Example**: After submitting a form, the server redirects the client to a confirmation page using `303 See Other`.

* **304 Not Modified**
  **Use**: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use the cached version.
  **Example**: A client requests an image, but the server responds with `304 Not Modified` because the image hasn't changed since the last request.

* **305 Use Proxy**
  **Use**: The requested resource must be accessed through a proxy.
  **Example**: A resource can only be accessed through a specific proxy server, so the client is instructed to use the proxy.

* **307 Temporary Redirect**
  **Use**: Similar to `302`, but the client should use the same HTTP method for the new URL (e.g., POST remains POST).
  **Example**: After a user submits a POST request, the server temporarily redirects them to a different URL with `307 Temporary Redirect`.

* **308 Permanent Redirect**
  **Use**: Similar to `301`, but the client should use the same HTTP method for future requests.
  **Example**: A URL permanently moves, and the client is redirected to the new URL using the same HTTP method (`308 Permanent Redirect`).

---

### **4xx: Client Errors**

These codes indicate that the client made an error, and the request cannot be processed.

* **400 Bad Request**
  **Use**: The request was malformed or contained invalid syntax.
  **Example**: A client sends a malformed JSON payload to an API endpoint, and the server responds with `400 Bad Request`.

* **401 Unauthorized**
  **Use**: The client is not authenticated and must provide valid credentials.
  **Example**: A user tries to access a protected route without logging in, and the server responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

* **402 Payment Required**
  **Use**: Reserved for future use, typically related to payment systems.
  **Example**: A user is trying to make a purchase but has insufficient funds, and the server responds with `402 Payment Required`.

* **403 Forbidden**
  **Use**: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
  **Example**: A user tries to access an admin page without having admin privileges, and the server responds with `403 Forbidden`.

* **404 Not Found**
  **Use**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  **Example**: A user tries to visit a page that doesn't exist, and the server responds with `404 Not Found`.

* **405 Method Not Allowed**
  **Use**: The HTTP method used is not allowed for the requested resource.
  **Example**: A client tries to send a POST request to a route that only accepts GET requests, and the server responds with `405 Method Not Allowed`.

* **406 Not Acceptable**
  **Use**: The resource is not available in a format acceptable by the client.
  **Example**: A client requests a resource in JSON format, but the server only provides XML, so the server responds with `406 Not Acceptable`.

* **407 Proxy Authentication Required**
  **Use**: The client must authenticate with a proxy server.
  **Example**: The client needs to authenticate via a proxy before accessing the internet, and the server responds with `407 Proxy Authentication Required`.

* **408 Request Timeout**
  **Use**: The server timed out waiting for the client’s request.
  **Example**: The client takes too long to send data, and the server responds with `408 Request Timeout`.

* **409 Conflict**
  **Use**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
  **Example**: A user tries to update a resource that has been modified by someone else, and the server responds with `409 Conflict`.

* **410 Gone**
  **Use**: The resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.
  **Example**: A client requests a page that has been permanently removed, and the server responds with `410 Gone`.

* **411 Length Required**
  **Use**: The server requires the `Content-Length` header to be set.
  **Example**: A client sends a POST request without specifying the `Content-Length`, and the server responds with `411 Length Required`.

* **412 Precondition Failed**
  **Use**: The server does not meet one of the preconditions specified by the client.
  **Example**: A conditional request (e.g., `If-Modified-Since`) fails, and the server responds with `412 Precondition Failed`.

* **413 Payload Too Large**
  **Use**: The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
  **Example**: A client tries to upload a file that's too large, and the server responds with `413 Payload Too Large`.

* **414 URI Too Long**
  **Use**: The URI provided is too long for the server to process.
  **Example**: A client sends a request with a very long query string, and the server responds with `414 URI Too Long`.

* **415 Unsupported Media Type**
  **Use**: The media type of the request is not supported by the server.
  **Example**: A client sends a request with a file format that the server does not support, and the server responds with `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

* **416 Range Not Satisfiable**
  **Use**: The range specified by the client in the `Range` header cannot be fulfilled.
  **Example**: A client requests a range of bytes outside the available file size, and the server


responds with `416 Range Not Satisfiable`.

* **417 Expectation Failed**
  **Use**: The server cannot meet the requirements of the `Expect` header.
  **Example**: The client requests an expectation that the server can't fulfill (e.g., `Expect: 100-continue`), and the server responds with `417 Expectation Failed`.

---

### **5xx: Server Errors**

These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

* **500 Internal Server Error**
  **Use**: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.
  **Example**: An unexpected error occurs in the server code, and the server responds with `500 Internal Server Error`.

* **501 Not Implemented**
  **Use**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
  **Example**: The client tries to use an HTTP method that the server does not support, and the server responds with `501 Not Implemented`.

* **502 Bad Gateway**
  **Use**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
  **Example**: A reverse proxy server forwards a request to an upstream server that fails, and the proxy responds with `502 Bad Gateway`.

* **503 Service Unavailable**
  **Use**: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to maintenance or overloading.
  **Example**: A server is under maintenance, and the client receives a `503 Service Unavailable`.

* **504 Gateway Timeout**
  **Use**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
  **Example**: A reverse proxy server times out while waiting for an upstream server's response, and it responds with `504 Gateway Timeout`.

* **505 HTTP Version Not Supported**
  **Use**: The server does not support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request.
  **Example**: The client uses an outdated HTTP version, and the server responds with `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`.

---

This list covers **all the main HTTP status codes** along with their uses, along with **real-world examples** to help you understand how they work in practice. Would you like to explore any of these in further detail?


Absolutely! Here's a more detailed and example-rich explanation for all 10 questions:

---

### **1. What is the difference between `app.use()` and `app.all()` in Express?**

* **`app.use()`** is used to apply middleware to all HTTP methods for a specific route or base path. It’s commonly used for authentication, logging, or parsing middleware.

  ```js
  app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received for API');
    next();
  });
  ```

* **`app.all()`** is used to define a route handler that responds to **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) on a specific route.

  ```js
  app.all('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Server is healthy');
  });
  ```

---

### **2. How do you prevent cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues in Express?**

CORS issues occur when a web app tries to make a request to a server from a different origin. You can handle this with the [`cors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) middleware:

```bash
npm install cors
```

**Usage:**

```js
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors()); // Enable for all routes and origins

// To restrict CORS to a specific origin:
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://myfrontend.com',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
}));
```

This will enable or restrict cross-origin access to your API based on configuration.

---

### **3. What are `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params` in Express?**

These represent different parts of an HTTP request:

* **`req.params`**: For URL route parameters like `/users/:id`
* **`req.query`**: For query strings like `/search?term=shoes`
* **`req.body`**: For POST/PUT data, typically JSON or form data

**Example:**

```js
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;         // /users/42 → 42
  const includePosts = req.query.posts; // /users/42?posts=true → true
  res.send(`User: ${userId}, Include posts: ${includePosts}`);
});
```

To use `req.body`, you need body-parsing middleware:

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

---

### **4. How would you implement authentication in an Express app?**

You can use **JWT (JSON Web Token)** or **Passport.js** for authentication.

**Using JWT (basic example):**

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Generate token
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'secret_key', { expiresIn: '1h' });

// Middleware to verify token
function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret_key');
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).send('Invalid token');
  }
}

app.use('/protected', verifyToken);
```

**Using Passport.js:**

* Passport has strategies for local, Google, GitHub, etc.
* Use `passport.authenticate('jwt')` for JWT-based auth.

---

### **5. What is the purpose of `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`?**

These are built-in Express middleware used to parse incoming request bodies:

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parses URL-encoded form data
```

**When to use:**

* Use `express.json()` for APIs sending JSON in requests.
* Use `express.urlencoded()` for HTML forms (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

---

### **6. How do you handle file uploads in Express?**

Use the `multer` middleware to handle multipart/form-data for file uploads.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install multer
```

**Example:**

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('profilePic'), (req, res) => {
  res.send(`File uploaded: ${req.file.originalname}`);
});
```

You can also use `upload.array()` for multiple files.

---

### **7. What is `app.listen()` in Express, and what are the arguments it takes?**

`app.listen()` starts the Express server and listens on a given port.

```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

**Arguments:**

* `port`: The port number to listen on.
* `hostname` (optional): Host IP (e.g., `'localhost'`)
* `callback`: Function to run once server is up.

---

### **8. What are the best practices for structuring an Express.js application?**

For large applications, follow modular structure:

```
project/
├── app.js
├── routes/
│   └── users.js
├── controllers/
│   └── userController.js
├── models/
│   └── userModel.js
├── middleware/
│   └── auth.js
├── config/
│   └── db.js
```

**Best practices:**

* Separate logic into controllers
* Use route files to register paths
* Apply middleware globally or per route
* Use environment variables via `dotenv`
* Keep business logic out of route handlers

---

### **9. How would you configure Express to use a template engine (e.g., EJS, Pug)?**

**Setup Example with EJS:**

```bash
npm install ejs
```

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', './views');

app.get('/welcome', (req, res) => {
  res.render('welcome', { name: 'Sai' });
});
```

In `/views/welcome.ejs`:

```ejs
<h1>Welcome <%= name %></h1>
```

You can also use `Pug`, `Handlebars`, etc. by setting the engine name and installing the respective package.

---

### **10. How does Express.js handle async operations in routing?**

Express supports `async` route handlers. If an `async` function throws an error, you should catch it or use a middleware for centralized error handling.

**Example:**

```js
app.get('/user/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const user = await db.getUser(req.params.id);
    res.json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // forward to error handler
  }
});
```

**Tip:** Use a wrapper function to auto-catch errors:

```js
const asyncHandler = fn => (req, res, next) => {
  Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
};

app.get('/user/:id', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.getUser(req.params.id);
  res.json(user);
}));
```

---

Certainly! Below are well-structured, clear, and example-rich answers for each of the Express.js performance, security, and scalability questions:

---

### **1. How can you improve the performance of an Express application?**

Improving performance in an Express app involves optimizing how it handles requests, processes data, and interacts with other services.

**Techniques to improve performance:**

* **Use Compression**: Compress responses to reduce payload size.

  ```js
  const compression = require('compression');
  app.use(compression());
  ```

* **Enable GZIP on the server** and use `helmet()` to reduce unnecessary headers.

* **Avoid blocking the event loop**: Use asynchronous, non-blocking code. Avoid CPU-intensive operations inside request handlers.

* **Use connection pooling** when interacting with databases.

* **Implement caching**: Store frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., with Redis) to reduce repeated DB calls.

* **Paginate API responses**: Prevent sending large datasets at once.

* **Load only what’s needed**: Lazy-load routes or middleware as needed.

* **Optimize queries and indexes** in the database.

* **Use a reverse proxy (like NGINX)** to handle SSL termination and serve static content.

---

### **2. What are the common security issues in Express apps, and how do you mitigate them?**

Common security threats in Express applications:

#### 🔒 **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

* Occurs when malicious scripts are injected into webpages.
* **Prevention**:

  * Escape user input in rendered templates.
  * Use templating engines that automatically escape output (e.g., EJS).
  * Use libraries like `xss-clean` or `DOMPurify`.

#### 🔒 **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

* Exploits the user’s credentials to make unauthorized actions.
* **Prevention**:

  * Use CSRF tokens with libraries like `csurf`.
  * Validate origin headers on sensitive routes.

  ```js
  const csrf = require('csurf');
  app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));
  ```

#### 🔒 **SQL Injection**

* Happens when user input is directly used in SQL queries.
* **Prevention**:

  * Use ORM/ODM (like Sequelize, Prisma, or Mongoose).
  * Always validate and sanitize user input.

#### ✅ **General Express Security Tips:**

* Use `helmet()` to set secure HTTP headers.

  ```js
  const helmet = require('helmet');
  app.use(helmet());
  ```

* Disable `x-powered-by` header.

  ```js
  app.disable('x-powered-by');
  ```

### **3. What is clustering in Express.js?**

Node.js is single-threaded, but modern machines have multiple CPU cores. **Clustering** allows you to take advantage of these cores by creating child processes (workers) that share the same server port.

**Usage Example:**

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const os = require('os');
const express = require('express');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  const app = express();
  app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send(`Handled by ${process.pid}`));
  app.listen(3000);
}
```

**Benefits:**

* Handles more concurrent requests.
* Improves reliability (if a worker crashes, it can be restarted).

**Note:** Clustering doesn't share memory—each worker is a separate process.

### **4. How do you implement rate-limiting in Express?**

Rate-limiting prevents abuse (like brute-force attacks or API overuse) by limiting how many requests a client can make in a time window.

Use the `express-rate-limit` middleware:

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

**Example:**

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

You can customize it per route or user type (e.g., stricter limits on login routes).

### **5. How do you use caching strategies in Express applications?**

Caching reduces load on your server and database by storing and serving frequently accessed data quickly.

#### 🔸 **Types of caching:**

1. **In-memory caching** (e.g., using `node-cache` or `lru-cache`) for small-scale apps.
2. **Distributed caching** (e.g., Redis) for scalable, shared caches across instances.
3. **HTTP caching** via response headers like `Cache-Control`.

#### 🔸 **Example: In-memory cache**

```js
const NodeCache = require('node-cache');
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 60 }); // cache TTL 60 seconds

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const cachedData = cache.get('dataKey');
  if (cachedData) return res.json(cachedData);

  const data = getDataFromDB(); // fetch fresh data
  cache.set('dataKey', data);
  res.json(data);
});
```

#### 🔸 **Example: Redis cache**

```js
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.get('user:1', (err, data) => {
  if (data) {
    res.send(JSON.parse(data));
  } else {
    const user = getUserFromDB();
    client.setex('user:1', 3600, JSON.stringify(user));
    res.send(user);
  }
});
```
