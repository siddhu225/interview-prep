Here’s a clear, organized summary of the concepts you just shared, including **distributed locks, distributed caches, and CDNs**, and when to use them in system design:

---

## **Distributed Locks**

**What it is:**
A distributed lock is a mechanism to lock a resource across multiple systems or processes to prevent concurrent modifications. It ensures that only one process can hold the lock at a time.

**When to use:**

* You need to coordinate access to a shared resource across multiple services or servers.
* Locks need to persist for a short, well-defined period.
* Use cases:

  * **E-Commerce checkout:** Lock high-demand items while a user completes payment.
  * **Ride-sharing matchmaking:** Lock drivers while they are assigned to a rider.
  * **Distributed cron jobs:** Ensure only one server executes a scheduled task at a time.
  * **Online auctions:** Temporarily lock an item when processing a last-second bid.

**Key points for interviews:**

* Implemented using **Redis (Redlock)** or **ZooKeeper**.
* **Lock expiry:** Avoids deadlocks if a process crashes.
* **Locking granularity:** Single resource or group of resources.
* **Deadlocks:** Must design carefully to avoid cyclic waiting.

## **Distributed Cache**

**What it is:**
A cache that stores data in memory across multiple servers to reduce database load and latency.

**When to use:**

* Reduce expensive database queries.
* Store frequently accessed or expensive-to-compute data.
* Speed up complex queries or aggregated metrics.

**Key strategies:**

* **Eviction policies:** LRU, FIFO, LFU.
* **Cache invalidation:** Keep data up-to-date with the source.
* **Write strategies:**

  * **Write-through:** Write to cache + datastore simultaneously.
  * **Write-around:** Write to datastore directly, bypass cache.
  * **Write-back:** Write to cache, flush asynchronously to datastore.

**Data structures matter:**

* Redis supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, etc.
* Use appropriate structures for your use case (e.g., sorted sets for top-N queries).

**Popular technologies:**

* **Redis**, **Memcached**.

## **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**

**What it is:**
A globally distributed caching network to deliver content quickly based on user location.

**When to use:**

* Deliver static content (images, videos, JS/CSS).
* Cache dynamic content that is frequently accessed but infrequently updated.
* Reduce latency for geographically distributed users.

**Key points for interviews:**

* CDNs can cache **API responses**, not just static content.
* Eviction policies: TTL, invalidation on content change.
* Global network reduces latency and improves reliability.

**Popular CDNs:**

* **Cloudflare**, **Akamai**, **Amazon CloudFront**.

### **How they fit together in a system design:**

1. **API Gateway** → entry point, handles routing, auth, rate-limiting.
2. **Load Balancer** → distributes traffic across servers.
3. **Service Layer** → microservices performing core logic.
4. **Distributed Cache** → reduces database load, speeds up responses.
5. **Distributed Lock** → ensures safe access to shared resources.
6. **Queue / Stream** → handles asynchronous or high-throughput workloads.
7. **CDN** → serves content quickly to global users.

If you want, I can make a **visual system diagram** showing **API gateway, load balancer, cache, queue, locks, and CDN** working together in a scalable architecture. It’s super handy for interviews. Do you want me to do that?
