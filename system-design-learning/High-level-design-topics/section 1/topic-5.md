#### 1. Databases

Almost all system design problems require data storage. The choice of database is fundamental and depends heavily on the specific functional and non-functional requirements.

* **Relational Databases (RDBMS - SQL Databases):**
    * **Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
    * **Structure:** Store data in tables with predefined schemas, composed of rows (records) and columns (fields). Relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
    * **Key Features & Concepts:**
        * **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Declarative language for querying and managing relational data.
        * **ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability):** Guarantee reliable processing of database transactions, making them ideal for financial transactions, user records, and other critical data where strong consistency is paramount.
        * **SQL Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
            * **Consideration:** While powerful, complex or numerous joins can become a performance bottleneck in highly scaled systems, especially for read-heavy workloads.
        * **Indexes:** Data structures (often B-Trees or Hash Tables) that make data retrieval significantly faster by allowing the database to quickly locate rows based on column values without scanning the entire table.
            * **Advantages:** Support for arbitrary indexes (allowing optimization for various queries), multi-column indexes, and specialized indexes (e.g., geospatial for location data, full-text for search).
        * **Transactions:** Group multiple database operations into a single, atomic unit. Either all operations succeed (commit), or none do (rollback), ensuring data integrity (e.g., transferring money between accounts).
    * **Use Cases:** Transactional systems (e-commerce orders, banking), systems requiring strong consistency, complex ad-hoc queries, structured data with clear relationships.
    * **Interview Advice:** Often the default choice for "product design" interviews due to their versatility and ACID guarantees. Pick one (e.g., PostgreSQL) and understand its core features deeply.

* **NoSQL Databases (Not Only SQL):**
    * **Characteristics:** A broad category designed to accommodate diverse data models and handle large volumes of data with high scalability and flexibility, often sacrificing strong consistency for availability and partition tolerance (AP systems in CAP theorem).
    * **Common Types:**
        * **Key-Value Stores:** Simple, high-performance (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
        * **Document Databases:** Store data in flexible, semi-structured documents (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).
        * **Column-Family Stores:** Store data in columns grouped into "families" (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
        * **Graph Databases:** Optimized for highly interconnected data (e.g., Neo4j).
    * **Pros:** High scalability (horizontal), flexible schema, often higher performance for specific access patterns.
    * **Cons:** Lack of strong ACID guarantees in many cases, joins are typically not supported or are handled at the application level, can be less intuitive for complex relational data.
    * **Use Cases:** Large-scale distributed systems, real-time analytics, content management, social networking, IoT data.
    * **Interview Advice:** Understand the trade-offs compared to relational databases. Be familiar with at least one common example (e.g., DynamoDB or MongoDB).

* **Blob Storage (Object Storage):**
    * **Examples:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage.
    * **Purpose:** Optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured binary data ("blobs") like images, videos, audio files, backups, and large documents.
    * **Characteristics:** Highly durable, available, scalable (effectively unlimited capacity), and cost-effective for large volumes. Data is accessed via unique keys (URLs).
    * **Use Cases:**
        * Storing user-generated content (e.g., images for Instagram, videos for YouTube).
        * Storing static website assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
        * Backups and archives.
        * Data lakes for analytics.
    * **Key Concept: Pre-signed URLs:** Temporarily scoped URLs generated by the application server that allow clients to directly upload/download data to/from blob storage without routing through the application server. This offloads the app server, improves performance, and allows for resumable uploads and progress tracking.

* **Search-Optimized Databases (Search Engines):**
    * **Examples:** Elasticsearch, Apache Solr.
    * **Purpose:** Designed for fast and efficient full-text search, complex queries, and analytics on large text-heavy datasets.
    * **Key Concepts:**
        * **Inverted Indexes:** The core data structure. Maps words (tokens) to the documents containing them, allowing for rapid retrieval of documents that match a given search query.
        * **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or meaningful units.
        * **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running," "runs," "ran" -> "run") to match different forms of the same word.
        * **Fuzzy Search:** Algorithms that find results even with slight misspellings or variations (e.g., using edit distance).
        * **Relevance Scoring:** Algorithms to rank search results based on their relevance to the query.
    * **Use Cases:** Product search (e-commerce), log analysis, document search (e.g., Google Docs search), social media post search.
    * **Scaling:** Similar to other distributed databases, they scale by adding nodes to a cluster and sharding data.

#### 2. Caching

Caching is a critical technique to improve system performance and reduce the load on primary data stores by storing frequently accessed data closer to the users or application servers.

* **Examples:** Redis, Memcached, in-memory caches, CDN caches.
* **Mechanism:** A high-speed data storage layer that temporarily stores copies of data, so future requests for that data can be served faster than retrieving it from its primary source.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Cache Hit/Miss:** A "hit" means data was found in cache; a "miss" means it wasn't and had to be fetched from the original source.
    * **Cache Eviction Policies:** Strategies to remove items from a full cache (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used, LFU - Least Frequently Used, FIFO - First In, First Out).
    * **Cache Invalidation:** Ensuring cached data is up-to-date with the primary data store (e.g., write-through, write-back, time-based expiration, explicit invalidation).
    * **Distributed Caching:** Caching across multiple servers, requiring consistency mechanisms.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Storing frequently accessed query results or computed data.
    * Session management for stateless services.
    * Leaderboards, real-time analytics.
    * Rate limiting (often implemented with Redis).
* **Interview Advice:** Understand where to place caches (client-side, CDN, server-side, database), when to use them, and the challenges of cache invalidation and consistency.

#### 3. Message Queues & Streams

These technologies facilitate asynchronous communication and decoupled architectures in distributed systems.

* **Message Queues:**
    * **Examples:** Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus.
    * **Purpose:** Act as buffers between producers (services sending messages) and consumers (services processing messages). Decouple services, enabling asynchronous communication.
    * **Mechanism:** Messages are sent to a queue, stored, and then consumed by one or more consumers.
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Decoupling:** Producers and consumers don't need to be aware of each other's availability.
        * **Buffering/Load Leveling:** Absorb bursts of traffic, preventing overload on downstream services.
        * **Reliability:** Messages are durably stored until processed, preventing data loss.
        * **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks can be offloaded, allowing the main application to respond quickly.
    * **Use Cases:** Background job processing (e.g., image resizing, email sending), task queues, event-driven architectures.

* **Streams (Event Streams):**
    * **Examples:** Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Amazon Kinesis.
    * **Purpose:** Continuous flow of data records, acting as a distributed, append-only commit log.
    * **Mechanism:** Data is published to topics/streams and can be consumed by multiple consumers independently and concurrently. Support replayability of historical data.
    * **Key Concept: Consumer Groups:** Allow multiple consumers to process the same stream in parallel, distributing the workload and providing fault tolerance.
    * **Use Cases:** Real-time data processing, event sourcing, log aggregation, change data capture (CDC), real-time analytics dashboards.
    * **Difference from Queues:** While often used similarly, streams emphasize persistent, ordered logs and the ability for multiple consumers to read the same events independently, making them suitable for stateful stream processing and event sourcing.

#### 4. Load Balancers

Essential for distributing network traffic efficiently across multiple servers to ensure high availability and optimal resource utilization.

* **Mechanism:** Sits in front of a group of servers (web servers, application servers, databases) and distributes incoming client requests across them based on various algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash).
* **Benefits:**
    * **High Availability:** If one server fails, traffic is redirected to healthy servers.
    * **Scalability:** Allows horizontal scaling by adding more servers behind the load balancer.
    * **Performance:** Prevents individual servers from becoming overloaded.
    * **SSL Termination:** Can handle HTTPS decryption, offloading work from backend servers.
* **Types:**
    * **Hardware Load Balancers:** Dedicated physical devices.
    * **Software Load Balancers:** Nginx, HAProxy, cloud-native (AWS ELB/ALB, GCP Load Balancer).
* **Use Cases:** Almost every scalable distributed system, routing traffic to web servers, microservices, database replicas.

#### 5. API Gateway

A single entry point for all client requests, acting as a facade for backend services, especially in microservices architectures.

* **Mechanism:** Routes client requests to the appropriate microservice, often performs cross-cutting concerns.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Request Routing:** Directs requests to the correct backend service.
    * **Authentication/Authorization:** Centralized security enforcement.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Protects backend services from overload.
    * **Logging/Monitoring:** Centralized point for capturing request data.
    * **Protocol Translation:** Can translate requests from one protocol (e.g., HTTP) to another (e.g., gRPC) for backend services.
    * **Service Discovery:** Locates and manages the network locations of microservices.
* **Use Cases:** Microservices architectures, mobile backends, public APIs.
