Here‚Äôs a clear, structured summary of the **common system design patterns** you just shared, highlighting when and why to use them, with examples and pitfalls. This will help you internalize them for interviews.

---

## 1. **Pushing Realtime Updates**

**Problem:** Users need live updates‚Äîchat messages, notifications, dashboards.
**Solutions:**

* **Protocols:**

  * Start with **HTTP polling** (simplest).
  * Use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for unidirectional updates.
  * Use **WebSockets** for full-duplex, low-latency communication.
* **Server-side approaches:**

  * **Pub/Sub systems** (decouple publishers/subscribers, e.g., chat apps).
  * **Stateful servers** with consistent hashing for heavier processing (e.g., collaborative editing in Google Docs).
    **Trade-offs:** Polling is simple but inefficient; WebSockets/SSE need more infrastructure.

---

## 2. **Managing Long-Running Tasks**

**Problem:** Some operations (video encoding, reports, bulk tasks) take too long for synchronous handling.
**Solution:** Split into **immediate acknowledgment** + **background processing**.

* **Flow:**

  1. User submits request ‚Üí web server validates ‚Üí returns job ID.
  2. Worker processes jobs asynchronously from a **queue** (Redis, Kafka).
* **Key considerations:**

  * Job status tracking
  * Retry/failure handling
  * Dead-letter queues for problematic jobs
    **Pitfall:** Avoid unnecessary queuing for short tasks‚Äîit adds complexity without benefit.

---

## 3. **Dealing with Contention**

**Problem:** Multiple processes/users compete for the same resource (tickets, auctions).
**Solutions:**

* **Database-level:** Pessimistic/optimistic locking.
* **Distributed coordination:** Distributed locks (Redis, ZooKeeper), two-phase commit, or queue-based serialization.
  **Trade-offs:**
* Performance vs. strong consistency
* Simple DB locks vs. complex distributed locks
  **Pitfall:** Premature data sharding can cause more contention issues than it solves.

## 4. **Scaling Reads**

**Problem:** Reads grow faster than writes, causing bottlenecks (social feeds, dashboards).
**Solution:**

1. Optimize DB: indexes, denormalization
2. Horizontal scaling: read replicas
3. External caching: Redis, Memcached, CDNs
   **Key considerations:**

* Cache invalidation
* Replication lag
* Hot keys (popular items)
  **Ratio:** Read-to-write often 10:1 ‚Üí 100:1+ in high-traffic apps.

---

## 5. **Scaling Writes**

**Problem:** Write-heavy systems hit server/storage limits.
**Solutions:**

* Horizontal **sharding** (distribute across servers)
* Vertical partitioning (different data types on separate DBs)
* **Burst handling:** queues, load shedding
* **Batching writes** to reduce overhead
  **Key consideration:** Choosing a **good partition key** is critical to avoid hotspots.

---

## 6. **Handling Large Blobs**

**Problem:** Large files (videos, images) overwhelm servers.
**Solution:** Direct client ‚Üî storage uploads/downloads via **presigned URLs** + CDN delivery.

* Eliminates server as bottleneck
* Supports resumable uploads, progress tracking
  **Challenges:**
* Sync metadata with database
* Handle upload failures
* Lifecycle management

---

## 7. **Multi-Step Processes**

**Problem:** Complex workflows with multiple services, long-running tasks, retries.
**Solution:**

* **Single-server orchestration** (simple)
* **Workflow engines / durable execution systems** (Temporal, AWS Step Functions)
* Event sourcing: each step emits events to trigger next steps
  **Key insight:** Move from manual state tracking ‚Üí declarative workflow, guarantees **exactly-once execution** and audit trails.

---

## 8. **Proximity-Based Services**

**Problem:** Need to search entities by geographic location.
**Solutions:**

* Use **geospatial indexes** (PostGIS, Redis geo type, Elasticsearch geo queries)
* Divide areas into regions ‚Üí index entities for fast filtering
  **Tip:** Only needed for hundreds of thousands/millions of entities; for small datasets, scanning is fine.
  **Use case:** Uber, Gopuff.

---

## üîë Pattern Selection Strategy

* Often multiple patterns are combined:
  Example: **Video platform**

  * Uploads ‚Üí Large Blobs
  * Transcoding ‚Üí Long-Running Tasks
  * Progress ‚Üí Realtime Updates
  * Workflow ‚Üí Multi-Step Processes
* Start simple ‚Üí add complexity **only when necessary**.
* Recognizing patterns quickly in interviews demonstrates **architectural maturity**.

If you want, I can make a **one-page visual cheat sheet** that maps **patterns ‚Üí problem type ‚Üí solution ‚Üí tech examples**, which is great for system design interviews. It‚Äôll be like your ‚ÄúFAANG interview Swiss Army knife.‚Äù

Do you want me to make that?
