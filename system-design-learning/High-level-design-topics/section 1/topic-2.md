Here's a more detailed breakdown of the System Design Delivery Framework, expanding on each step:

### System Design Delivery Framework: Detailed Notes

This framework provides a structured and efficient way to approach system design interviews, ensuring you cover all critical aspects and effectively communicate your design.

---

#### 1. Requirements (Approx. 5 minutes)

This initial phase is crucial for understanding the problem space and setting the scope of your design.

* **Functional Requirements (FRs):** These define *what* the system must do. They are the core features and functionalities that users will interact with directly.
    * **Examples:**
        * "Users should be able to upload photos."
        * "Customers can search for products by name or category."
        * "The system must send notifications to users."
        * "Admins should be able to manage user accounts."
    * **Tip:** Think about the different types of users and their primary interactions with the system.

* **Non-functional Requirements (NFRs):** These define *how well* the system performs its functions. They are critical for understanding the constraints and quality attributes of the system.
    * **Key NFRs to discuss:**
        * **Scalability:** How does the system handle increasing load (users, data)?
        * **Latency:** How quickly does the system respond to requests? (e.g., "API response time should be under 200ms").
        * **Availability:** What percentage of the time is the system operational? (e.g., "99.99% uptime").
        * **Durability:** How reliably is data stored and retrieved? (e.g., data persistence even after failures).
        * **Consistency:** How is data consistency maintained across distributed systems? (e.g., eventual vs. strong consistency).
        * **Security:** Protection against unauthorized access, data breaches, etc. (e.g., authentication, authorization, encryption).
        * **Fault Tolerance/Resilience:** How does the system behave when parts of it fail? (e.g., graceful degradation, self-healing).
        * **Maintainability/Operability:** Ease of managing, monitoring, and updating the system.
        * **Cost:** Budget constraints for infrastructure.
        * **Compliance:** Meeting industry standards or regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    * **Tip:** Prioritize the most critical NFRs based on the problem statement and ask clarifying questions to the interviewer.

* **Capacity Estimation (Optional):**
    * Perform this *only if* it directly influences your design decisions (e.g., needing to choose a specific database type due to high read/write volume or storage needs).
    * **What to estimate:** Users (DAU/MAU), QPS (Queries Per Second), Storage needs (data per user, total data), Network bandwidth.
    * **Example:** "If we have 10 million users, and each uploads 5 photos per month, averaging 1MB per photo, that's 50 TB of new data per month."

#### 2. Core Entities (Approx. 2 minutes)

Identify the fundamental "nouns" or resources that your system will manage or operate on. These often translate directly to database tables or core data structures.

* **What they are:** The main objects or concepts central to the system's function.
* **Examples:**
    * For an e-commerce system: `User`, `Product`, `Order`, `Payment`.
    * For a social media platform: `User`, `Post`, `Comment`, `Like`.
    * For a ride-sharing app: `User`, `Driver`, `Ride`, `Vehicle`.
* **Tip:** Focus on simplicity and identify only the most critical entities at this stage.

---

#### 3. API or System Interface (Approx. 5 minutes)

Define how external clients or other services will interact with your system. A well-defined API acts as a contract.

* **Typical Approach:** RESTful API endpoints are commonly used.
* **What to define:**
    * **Endpoints:** The URLs for specific resources (e.g., `/users`, `/products/{id}`).
    * **HTTP Methods:** `GET` (retrieve), `POST` (create), `PUT`/`PATCH` (update), `DELETE` (remove).
    * **Request/Response Formats:** What data goes in and what comes out (e.g., JSON payload structure for creating a user, or the data returned when fetching a product).
    * **Authentication/Authorization:** How users/services prove their identity and what permissions they have (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).
* **Example (User Management API):**
    * `POST /users` (Create User): Request body: `{ "name": "...", "email": "..." }`
    * `GET /users/{id}` (Get User by ID): Response body: `{ "id": "...", "name": "...", "email": "..." }`
    * `PUT /users/{id}` (Update User): Request body: `{ "name": "..." }`
* **Tip:** This step forces you to think about how your system will be consumed and helps clarify the boundaries of your service.

#### 4. Data Flow (Optional - Approx. 5 minutes)

This step is particularly relevant for data-intensive systems, real-time processing, or systems with complex workflows.

* **When to use:** If the primary challenge or a significant aspect of the system involves how data moves through various stages, transformations, or asynchronous processes.
* **What to describe:**
    * **Ingestion:** How data enters the system.
    * **Processing:** What transformations or computations happen to the data.
    * **Storage:** Where the data is stored at different stages.
    * **Output/Consumption:** How processed data is consumed by other services or users.
    * **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:** Highlight if queues or messaging systems are involved.
* **Example (Image Processing Pipeline):**
    1.  User uploads image (API).
    2.  Image stored in Blob Storage.
    3.  Message sent to Queue (e.g., Kafka/SQS).
    4.  Worker service consumes message, downloads image.
    5.  Worker processes image (e.g., thumbnail generation, face detection).
    6.  Processed images/metadata stored in new location/database.
    7.  Notification sent to user.
* **Tip:** Use this to demonstrate understanding of event-driven architectures, messaging systems, and eventual consistency.

#### 5. High-Level Design (Approx. 10-15 minutes)

This is where you draw the main components of your system and illustrate how they interact to satisfy the core functional requirements.

* **Focus:** Start with the most critical components required for the core functionality. Don't get bogged down in too much detail initially.
* **Typical Components to Draw:**
    * **Clients:** Web, Mobile apps.
    * **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic.
    * **Web Servers/API Gateway:** Handle incoming requests.
    * **Application Servers/Microservices:** Business logic (e.g., User Service, Product Service, Order Service).
    * **Databases:** Relational (SQL) or Non-relational (NoSQL - Key-Value, Document, Columnar, Graph).
    * **Caching Layer:** Redis, Memcached.
    * **Message Queues:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS.
    * **Storage:** S3 (object storage), EBS (block storage).
    * **DNS:** Domain Name System.
    * **CDN:** Content Delivery Network.
* **Interaction Flow:** Show arrows indicating data flow between components.
* **Example:** User (Client) -> DNS -> Load Balancer -> Web Server -> Application Server -> Database.
* **Tip:** Clearly label each component and briefly explain its role. Prioritize drawing the components that fulfill the main use cases identified in the requirements.

---

#### 6. Deep Dives (Approx. 10 minutes)

This phase allows you to refine specific parts of your design, address complexities, and show your understanding of trade-offs and edge cases. This is often driven by interviewer questions.

* **Common Deep Dive Areas:**
    * **Database Schema/Choice:** Detail table design, indexing strategies, or reasons for choosing a specific NoSQL database. Discuss consistency models.
    * **API Design Details:** Error handling, versioning, rate limiting.
    * **Scaling Strategies:** How to handle increased load for a specific component (e.g., database sharding, read replicas, horizontal scaling of application servers, auto-scaling groups).
    * **Specific Component Design:** How would you design the "Notification Service" or the "Search Engine" in detail?
    * **Concurrency/Consistency Issues:** How to handle concurrent writes, distributed transactions.
    * **Fault Tolerance/Reliability:** How to ensure the system remains available during failures (e.g., retries, circuit breakers, redundancy, leader election).
    * **Security Considerations:** Authentication protocols, authorization mechanisms, data encryption at rest and in transit.
    * **Monitoring and Logging:** How to observe system health and debug issues.
    * **Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios:** What happens if a service goes down, network partitions, data corruption.
    * **Trade-offs:** Discuss pros and cons of different design choices (e.g., strong consistency vs. eventual consistency, relational vs. NoSQL, synchronous vs. asynchronous).
* **Tip:** Be prepared to justify your design choices and discuss alternatives. This is where you demonstrate your depth of knowledge and problem-solving skills.
