Absolutely! Below is a **comprehensive and structured set of detailed notes** on the **System Design Interview Delivery Framework** from the Hello Interview guide — broken into actionable steps with tips, pitfalls, and example content.

## 🔧 SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW FRAMEWORK — DETAILED NOTES

---

### **1. Requirements (First ~5 minutes)**

#### ✅ 1.1 Functional Requirements (What the system should do)

* Start by identifying the **primary features** based on the problem.
* Ask clarifying questions:
  *“Should users be able to search?”*
  *“Do we need real-time updates?”*
* Prioritize the top **3–4 core features**. Don’t list too many.

**Example** (Design Twitter):

* Users can post tweets.
* Users can follow/unfollow others.
* Users can see a feed of tweets from followed users.

#### ✅ 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements (Qualities of the system)

Use the **FCC + SLEDS** or **“Furry Cats Climb Steep Ledges Every Day Securely”** acronym:

| Acronym | NFR                     | Guiding Question                             |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| F       | Fault Tolerance         | How does it handle failure?                  |
| C       | CAP Theorem             | Prioritize Consistency or Availability?      |
| C       | Compliance              | Are there legal/data policies (e.g., GDPR)?  |
| S       | Scalability             | Can it handle growth in users/data/traffic?  |
| L       | Latency                 | What’s the acceptable response time?         |
| E       | Environment Constraints | Are there device/bandwidth constraints?      |
| D       | Durability              | Is data loss acceptable?                     |
| S       | Security                | Is the data encrypted and access controlled? |

**Example (Twitter)**:

* Highly available, prefer availability over consistency.
* Latency < 200ms for feed rendering.
* Scale to 100M+ DAU.
* Secure user authentication and tweet data.

---

### **2. Capacity Estimation (Optional)**

#### ✅ When to do it:

* Only **if it drives design choices**, like:

  * In-memory vs persistent storage
  * Whether to shard data or not
  * Using queues vs direct writes

#### ❌ When to skip:

* Don’t waste time estimating DAU/QPS if it doesn’t change your architecture.
* If interviewer wants it, do it **with purpose**.

**Example**:
Design Trending Topics (TopK)

* Estimate number of tweets per second (say 100K QPS)
* Helps choose between heap-in-memory or distributed counter

---

### **3. Core Entities (2–3 minutes)**

#### ✅ Purpose:

* Capture key **data objects/entities** the system operates on.

#### ✅ How to identify:

* Ask: “What are the nouns in this system?”
* Who are the actors? What resources do they act upon?

#### ✅ Example (Twitter):

* `User`: id, name, handle
* `Tweet`: id, user_id, text, timestamp
* `Follow`: follower_id, followee_id

Start simple — evolve as the design grows.

---

### **4. API or System Interface (5 minutes)**

#### ✅ Define how users or services interact with your system

* Use **REST** by default (safe choice).
* Consider **GraphQL** for dynamic querying by clients.
* Use **gRPC** for service-to-service comms in microservices.

**REST Example (Twitter):**

```http
POST /v1/tweets
{
  "text": "Hello world"
}

GET /v1/feed  → returns list of tweets

POST /v1/users/{userId}/follow
{
  "target_user_id": 123
}
```

#### 🔐 Tips:

* Don’t pass sensitive data in body (e.g., user_id) — derive from auth token.
* Follow REST naming conventions (`/tweets`, not `/tweet`).

---

### **5. (Optional) Data Flow (~5 minutes)**

Useful for systems with **ETL**, streaming, or **pipelines**.

#### Example: Web Crawler

1. Fetch seed URLs
2. Parse HTML
3. Extract links
4. Store content & metadata
5. Repeat

Use this to explain the **flow of data/events** through the system.

---

### **6. High-Level Design (10–15 minutes)**

#### ✅ Your architecture diagram (boxes & arrows)

* Start from **API Gateway** or client → backend services → databases, caches, queues
* Each API maps to components that handle:

  * **Routing**
  * **Business logic**
  * **Persistence**
  * **Asynchronous work (queues)**

#### ✅ Tips:

* Start simple, then layer complexity.
* Focus on **data flow** per request — walk through how a write/read happens.
* Mention:

  * Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)
  * Caches (Redis, Memcached)
  * Indexing
  * Load Balancing
  * Microservices (if any)

#### Example (Design Twitter):

* **Write Path**:
  Client → API Gateway → Tweet Service → DB
  → Fanout service (for updating followers’ feed, async)

* **Read Path**:
  Client → API Gateway → Feed Service
  → Redis Cache or precomputed feed → DB fallback

---

### **7. Deep Dives (Last 10 minutes)**

#### ✅ Purpose:

* **Stress-test** your design.
* Address trade-offs, scalability, bottlenecks.
* Show how your system meets **non-functional requirements**.

#### ✅ What to focus on:

* **Caching strategy** (What to cache? How to invalidate?)
* **Scalability** (Horizontal vs vertical scaling, sharding)
* **Feed Generation** (fanout-on-read vs fanout-on-write)
* **Database choices** (SQL vs NoSQL, eventual consistency)
* **Rate limiting, load shedding**
* **Monitoring & Observability**
* **Security: auth, encryption at rest/in-transit**

#### 💬 Example prompts to self-start:

> “To meet the 100M DAU scalability target, I’d shard tweets by user ID...”

> “To reduce feed latency, I’ll cache the timeline in Redis and update it async on new tweets.”

> “For durability, I’ll persist all tweets to S3 before acknowledging writes.”

## 🛑 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                | Why it hurts                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Listing 10+ functional requirements    | You won’t get through even 3 in time            |
| Starting with tech before requirements | You’re building a solution without a problem    |
| Deep diving too early                  | You won’t finish end-to-end, which matters most |
| Ignoring API design                    | That’s the contract your system must satisfy    |
| Not discussing monitoring or metrics   | Shows immaturity in production-readiness        |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

* Think like a **builder** and a **scaler**.
* Be **collaborative** — ask interviewer what assumptions are okay.
* Be **intentional** — only do math/design trade-offs when they matter.
* Be **adaptable** — some interviewers go deep early, be ready to adjust.

Would you like a **notion template**, **printable checklist**, or a **system design template** for whiteboarding practice?

Or, we can go through a **mock interview** (e.g., Design Instagram Stories) step-by-step using this framework.
