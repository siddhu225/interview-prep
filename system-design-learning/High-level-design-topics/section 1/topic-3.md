# 📘 System Design Notes: **Scaling**

---

## 🔹 1. What Is Scaling?

**Scaling** is about handling increased load by improving system capacity or performance.

There are two major types:

* **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):** Add more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single machine.
* **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):** Add more machines to handle increased traffic/workload.

---

## 🔹 2. Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling

| Aspect              | Vertical Scaling                        | Horizontal Scaling                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**          | Add more power (CPU, RAM) to one server | Add more servers/machines                          |
| **Complexity**      | Simple (less incremental complexity)    | Complex (needs coordination and data distribution) |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Efficient for small-medium scale        | Better at very large scale                         |
| **Bottleneck**      | Limited by max capacity of one machine  | Scales almost indefinitely (in theory)             |
| **Examples**        | Upgrading to a larger EC2 instance      | Adding more EC2 instances behind a load balancer   |

👉 **Rule of thumb:**
If vertical scaling can handle expected growth **without major complexity**, prefer it first.
Horizontal scaling adds **distributed system challenges** (work, data, and state management).

---

## 🔹 3. Common Mistakes in Scaling (Interview Traps)

1. **Premature Horizontal Scaling:**
   Jumping to add machines without checking if vertical scaling or optimization is enough.

2. **Ignoring Implications:**
   Forgetting that horizontal scaling affects data consistency, coordination, and fault tolerance.

💡 **Remember:**

> Don’t throw machines at a poor design. Optimize before scaling out.

---

## 🔹 4. When Horizontal Scaling Is Needed

When load exceeds the capacity of a single machine (e.g. high request volume, data size, or concurrent users), we horizontally scale.

This requires:

* **Work distribution**
* **Data distribution**
* **Consistency management**

---

## 🔹 5. Work Distribution

**Goal:** Send each request to the “right” machine to keep system load balanced.

### 🔸 Techniques

* **Load Balancer:**
  Routes requests to backend servers.
  Strategies include:

  * *Round Robin* — simple and often sufficient.
  * *Least Connections* — pick the node with the fewest active requests.
  * *Utilization-based* — based on CPU/memory usage.

* **Queue-based Distribution:**
  For async jobs (e.g., background processing), work is distributed via a **queueing system**.

### 🔸 Balancing the Load

* The load should be evenly spread.
  Example problem: one node is 90% busy, others 10% — poor utilization.
* Proper hashing or distribution strategy (e.g., **Consistent Hashing**) can help maintain balance.

---

## 🔹 6. Consistent Hashing (Key Concept)

**Why it’s used:**
When machines are added or removed, we want **minimal data redistribution**.

**How it works:**

* Both data and machines are mapped into a circular space (a **hash ring**).
* Each machine is responsible for the segment of the ring between itself and its predecessor.
* When a machine is added/removed → only a small fraction of keys are remapped.

💡 **Used by:** Distributed caches, CDNs, sharded databases, etc.

---

## 🔹 7. Data Distribution

**Goal:** Ensure data is accessible where it’s needed, without excessive network calls.

### 🔸 Key Concepts

1. **Local vs Shared Data**

   * *Local:* Data stored in-memory on the node handling the request.
   * *Shared:* Data in a central database accessed by all nodes.

2. **Data Partitioning (Sharding):**

   * Split data into subsets handled by different nodes.
   * Ideally, one node can process a request **without contacting others**.
   * If it must contact others → this is called **fan-out**.

3. **Avoid Scatter-Gather:**

   * Scatter-gather = request sent to many nodes and results combined.
   * Problems:

     * High network traffic
     * Sensitive to failures
     * High *tail latency* (slowest node delays whole request)

4. **Geographical Partitioning:**

   * Partition by **REGION_ID** (e.g., US vs EU users).
   * Reduces cross-region communication.
   * Works well for region-specific use cases (e.g., location-based apps).

---

## 🔹 8. Data Consistency Challenges

Horizontal scaling introduces **synchronization and consistency** issues:

* Multiple copies of data across machines.
* Writes and reads may conflict (race conditions).

### 🔸 Solutions

* **Use Transactions** (DB-level consistency)
* **Distributed Locks** for shared resources
* **Replication Strategies:**

  * *Leader-Follower (Master-Slave):* Strong consistency.
  * *Multi-leader or Eventual Consistency:* Better performance but weaker consistency.

**Network Latency Note:**
Accessing a shared DB adds ~1–10ms latency (even in ideal setups).


## 🔹 10. Extra 1–2 Important Points (Added for Completeness)

1. **Monitoring & Auto-Scaling:**
   Real systems often use metrics (CPU, request rate, latency) to automatically add/remove nodes.

2. **State Management:**
   Stateless services are easier to scale horizontally.
   If the service must keep state, use external state stores (like Redis or databases).

Absolutely — here are your **notes on the CAP Theorem**, formatted exactly in the same style and structure as the first version you liked earlier. These notes are clean, structured, and detailed enough for strong conceptual understanding and quick revision.

---

# 📘 System Design Notes: **CAP Theorem**

---

## 🔹 1. Overview

The **CAP Theorem** is a fundamental principle in **distributed systems** that describes the trade-offs between three essential properties:

1. **Consistency (C)**
2. **Availability (A)**
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**

It states that **a distributed system can only guarantee two of these three properties at the same time** — not all three.

---

## 🔹 2. The Three Properties Explained

### **Consistency (C)**

All nodes see the same data at the same time.

* When a write occurs, all subsequent reads return the same updated value, no matter which node is accessed.
* Ensures every user sees the most recent data.
* During network partitions, nodes may become **unavailable** to maintain this strict consistency.

### **Availability (A)**

Every request receives a response — **even if some nodes fail or are unreachable.**

* System remains operational during failures.
* However, nodes might return **stale or outdated data**, leading to temporary inconsistencies.
* The system typically resolves these inconsistencies later (eventual consistency).

### **Partition Tolerance (P)**

The system continues to operate **despite network partitions** (communication failures between nodes).

* In real-world distributed systems, partitions are **unavoidable** — so every practical system must tolerate them.

---

## 🔹 3. The Trade-off

Since network partitions **will happen**, a system must **choose between consistency and availability** when a partition occurs.

| Choice                                        | Behavior During Partition                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency over Availability (CP System)** | Some nodes become unavailable to keep data consistent.               |
| **Availability over Consistency (AP System)** | All nodes stay available but might return stale or conflicting data. |

**In practice:**

* You cannot have both perfect consistency and availability once a partition occurs.
* You must design based on which property your system values more.

---

## 🔹 4. Choosing Between Consistency and Availability

### **When Choosing Consistency (CP Systems)**

* Prioritize **correctness of data** over responsiveness.
* All nodes must agree on data before responding.
* During partitions, some nodes may reject requests to preserve data integrity.

**Used in systems where stale data cannot be tolerated.**

---

### **When Choosing Availability (AP Systems)**

* Prioritize **serving requests** over strict correctness.
* Nodes continue to respond, even if they are temporarily inconsistent.
* The system will **eventually reconcile** differences once partitions are resolved.

**Used when system uptime is critical, and temporary inconsistency is acceptable.**

---

## 🔹 5. Practical Guidance for Interviews

In most **system design interviews**, **availability** should be your default choice.
Real-world systems often choose to remain available because:

* Network partitions are rare but possible.
* Users prefer delayed accuracy over complete unavailability.
* Eventual consistency is often “good enough” for most use cases.

You should explicitly discuss *why* you’re choosing one over the other in your design.

---

## 🔹 6. Systems That Require Strong Consistency (CP Systems)

Certain systems cannot tolerate even temporary inconsistency because it could lead to severe issues. Examples include:

1. **Inventory Management Systems**

   * Must track stock levels precisely to avoid overselling.

2. **Booking Systems (Flights, Hotels, Events)**

   * Prevents **double booking** by ensuring only one successful reservation per resource.

3. **Banking Systems**

   * Balances must be accurate across all nodes to prevent fraud or overdrafts.

**Key Characteristic:**
Any inconsistency — even short-term — can cause **financial loss, data corruption, or legal issues.**

---

## 🔹 7. Systems That Prefer Availability (AP Systems)

Systems that can tolerate temporary inconsistency usually prioritize staying online and responsive. Examples include:

* **Social media feeds** (posts may appear out of order)
* **Shopping carts** in e-commerce (items may show slightly outdated availability)
* **Content delivery systems** (replicas may sync later)

These systems eventually synchronize, making them **eventually consistent** rather than strongly consistent.

---

## 🔹 8. Summary Comparison

| Property      | Consistency                           | Availability                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Guarantee** | All nodes show the same data          | Every node responds                     |
| **Tolerance** | May reject requests during partition  | May return stale data                   |
| **Use Case**  | Financial, booking, inventory systems | Social apps, caches, web services       |
| **Trade-off** | Lower uptime for data accuracy        | Higher uptime with eventual consistency |

---

## 🔹 9. Key Interview Takeaway

✅ Always acknowledge that **Partition Tolerance is mandatory** in distributed systems.
✅ Then, clearly justify whether your design is **CP** (consistency-first) or **AP** (availability-first).
✅ Remember that **availability** is the usual default — but **consistency** is mandatory for critical systems like banking or inventory tracking.



Absolutely — here are your **notes on “Locking”**, written in the **exact same structured and clear style** as your first version (Scaling and CAP Theorem).
They are detailed, cleanly organized, and ready for repeated revision.

---

# 📘 System Design Notes: **Locking**

---

## 🔹 1. Overview

In distributed or multi-client systems, **locking** is the process of ensuring that **only one client can access a shared resource at a time**.

Locks prevent conflicting operations on shared data — such as when multiple users try to update the same record, counter, or physical device simultaneously.

**Examples of shared resources:**

* Inventory counters (e.g., stock units)
* User accounts or balances
* Interfaces to physical devices (e.g., “drawbridge up!” command)

Locks exist at **every level** of computing:

* Operating system (kernel locks)
* Application-level locks
* Database locks
* **Distributed locks** (for multi-node systems)

Locks are critical for **correctness**, but if used poorly, they can seriously **hurt performance**.

---

## 🔹 2. Why Locks Are Needed

Locks are primarily used to prevent **race conditions** — situations where multiple clients try to read or write a shared resource at the same time.

**Race conditions can cause:**

* Data corruption
* Lost updates
* Inconsistent state

In system design interviews, whenever a shared resource is involved, you’ll often need to discuss how your system handles locking or concurrency.

---

## 🔹 3. Key Considerations When Using Locks

There are **three main aspects** to manage when employing locks effectively:

---

### **1. Granularity of the Lock**

**Definition:**
How much of the system is locked at once.

**Goal:**
Make locks **as fine-grained as possible**, meaning lock only the smallest portion of data required to perform an operation.

**Example:**
If updating a user’s profile, lock only **that specific user’s record**, not the entire user table.

**Why it matters:**

* Fine-grained locks increase concurrency (more clients can work simultaneously).
* Coarse-grained locks reduce performance by blocking unrelated operations.

**Trade-off:**
Finer granularity improves performance but increases implementation complexity.

---

### **2. Duration of the Lock**

**Definition:**
How long a lock is held before being released.

**Goal:**
Hold locks **for the shortest possible time** — only for the **critical section** of code that requires exclusive access.

**Example:**
If updating a user’s profile:

* Lock only during the update operation.
* Release the lock immediately after writing changes.

**Why it matters:**

* Shorter lock duration → fewer blocked clients → better throughput.
* Long-held locks → bottlenecks and slower system performance.

**Tip:**
Avoid doing non-critical work (like logging or external API calls) while holding a lock.

---

### **3. Whether the Lock Can Be Avoided**

In many cases, full locking can be **bypassed** using **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**.

---

## 🔹 4. Optimistic Concurrency Control

**Concept:**
Instead of locking, assume that **conflicts are rare**, and allow operations to proceed without locking.
Before committing changes, verify that no one else modified the data in the meantime.

**Mechanism:**

* Perform your read or computation.
* Before writing, check if the resource’s version or state has changed.
* If it’s unchanged, commit your update.
* If it has changed, retry the operation.

**Common Technique:**

* **Compare and Swap (CAS)** — atomically update a value only if it matches an expected old value.

**When it works well:**

* When contention is **rare** (few concurrent updates).
* When operations can be **retried safely**.
* For **read-heavy** systems.

**Example:**

* Updating a blog post’s “like” counter or a profile setting.
* Retry if another user updated it in the meantime.

---

## 🔹 5. When Locking Is Necessary (Pessimistic Concurrency)

Not all systems can use optimistic control.
In systems where correctness is critical, you must **lock the resource explicitly** to prevent conflicts.

**Example:**

* **Bank account updates:**
  You cannot assume no one else is modifying the account.
  The system must ensure only one transaction modifies the balance at a time.

**In such cases:**

* Pessimistic locking is required.
* The system acquires a lock before the operation and releases it afterward.

**Trade-off:**
Pessimistic locking ensures correctness but can reduce availability and throughput if locks are held for too long.

---

## 🔹 6. Distributed Locks

In distributed systems with multiple servers, locks need to work **across machines**.
This is typically achieved using tools like:

* **Redis Redlock**
* **Zookeeper**
* **Etcd**

These provide mechanisms to:

* Acquire and release locks across nodes.
* Handle node failures gracefully.
* Avoid duplicate or conflicting access to shared resources.

However, distributed locks introduce their own challenges:

* **Network latency**
* **Failure handling**
* **Leader election or timeout coordination**

---

## 🔹 7. Balancing Correctness and Performance

Locks improve **correctness** but reduce **concurrency**.
When designing systems:

* Keep locks **fine-grained** and **short-lived**.
* Use **optimistic approaches** whenever feasible.
* Apply **pessimistic locks** only where data correctness is critical.

**Goal:**
Achieve the right balance between **safety** and **speed**.

---

## 🔹 8. Summary Comparison

| Aspect               | Fine-Grained / Short Lock | Coarse-Grained / Long Lock |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Performance**      | High concurrency          | Low concurrency            |
| **Complexity**       | Higher                    | Lower                      |
| **Risk of Conflict** | Higher                    | Lower                      |
| **Use Case**         | High-traffic systems      | Simple or critical systems |

---

## 🔹 9. Key Takeaway

✅ Locks are essential for preventing race conditions and ensuring correctness.
✅ Always focus on **granularity**, **duration**, and **necessity** of locks.
✅ Use **optimistic concurrency** where contention is rare.
✅ Use **pessimistic locks** for critical, sensitive updates like financial or inventory transactions.
