### Core Concepts for System Design Interviews: Advanced Details

This section dives deeper into the essential concepts, providing more context and considerations crucial for a robust system design discussion.

#### 1. Scaling

Scaling is the ability of a system to handle increasing load. The article emphasizes the significant implications of horizontal scaling.

* **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):**
    * **Mechanism:** Enhancing the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of a single server.
    * **Pros:** Simpler to implement initially, as it doesn't introduce distributed system complexities.
    * **Cons:** Has inherent hardware limitations (you can only scale up so much), and the single machine becomes a single point of failure (SPOF).
* **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):**
    * **Mechanism:** Adding more servers or instances to distribute the workload.
    * **Pros:** Theoretically limitless scalability, increased fault tolerance and availability by distributing risk.
    * **Challenges (Critical for System Design):** Horizontal scaling introduces significant complexity that needs to be addressed:
        * **Work Distribution:** How incoming requests or tasks are evenly spread across multiple servers.
            * **Solutions:** Load balancers (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB), Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) for asynchronous tasks.
        * **Data Distribution:** How data is partitioned and stored across multiple database instances or storage nodes.
            * **Solutions:** Sharding/Partitioning techniques. This directly impacts data access patterns.
        * **State Management:** How to manage session state or other shared mutable data when requests can hit any server.
            * **Solutions:** Externalizing state (e.g., using a distributed cache like Redis, a shared database), making services stateless.

* **Consistent Hashing:**
    * **Purpose:** A specific technique for **Work Distribution** and **Data Distribution** across a dynamic set of servers or caches.
    * **Mechanism:** Maps both data items and servers onto a "hash ring." When a new server is added or removed, it minimizes the amount of data that needs to be remapped or moved, making it highly efficient for elastic scaling.
    * **Benefit:** Reduces data redistribution (rebalancing) overhead significantly compared to simple modulo hashing when the number of nodes changes.

#### 2. Data Distribution & Synchronization

Distributing data across multiple nodes is essential for scalability but introduces complexity, especially around maintaining data integrity.

* **Challenges of Distributed Data Access:**
    * **"Scatter Gather" Anti-pattern:** This occurs when a single client request needs to query multiple data shards (scatter) and then combine their results (gather) to form a complete response.
        * **Implication:** Leads to increased latency (due to multiple network hops and waiting for all sub-responses) and increased network traffic. Can become a bottleneck.
    * **Synchronization:** When data is replicated or partitioned across multiple nodes, ensuring that all copies are consistent becomes a major challenge.
        * **Race Conditions:** When multiple operations concurrently access and modify shared data, the final outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution, leading to incorrect or inconsistent data.

* **Consistency Models:**
    * **Strong Consistency:** Guarantees that every read returns the most recent write. All clients see the same data at the same time. Requires significant coordination overhead (e.g., distributed transactions).
    * **Eventual Consistency:** Guarantees that if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all reads will return the last updated value. This model tolerates network partitions better and offers higher availability and performance but might show stale data for a short period.
    * **Other Models:** Causal consistency, sequential consistency, etc., which offer different trade-offs.

#### 3. CAP Theorem

This is a cornerstone concept for distributed systems, illustrating fundamental trade-offs.

* **Core Statement:** In a distributed system, you can only pick **two** out of three guarantees:
    * **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
    * **Availability (A):** Every request receives a non-error response (though it might not be the latest data).
    * **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate even if there are network failures that prevent communication between nodes (network partitions are unavoidable in large distributed systems).
* **Practical Implications:** Since network partitions are an inherent reality in distributed systems, the practical choice often boils down to a trade-off between **Consistency** and **Availability**.
    * **CP System (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** Prioritizes strong consistency. If a partition occurs, the system will become unavailable on the side of the partition that cannot guarantee consistency (e.g., by returning an error).
        * **Use Cases:** Banking systems (money transfers), inventory management (stock levels) where data accuracy is paramount.
    * **AP System (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** Prioritizes availability. If a partition occurs, the system remains available, but it might serve stale data (eventual consistency).
        * **Use Cases:** Social media feeds, recommendation engines, chat systems where showing slightly outdated information is acceptable for continuous service.
* **Flexibility:** Different features within the same system can (and often should) adhere to different consistency requirements based on their specific needs.

#### 4. Locking

Locks are mechanisms to control access to shared resources in a concurrent environment.

* **Purpose:** To prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity by allowing only one process/thread to access a critical section of code or data at a time.
* **Concerns with Locks:**
    * **Granularity:**
        * **Fine-grained locks:** Lock only the specific portion of data or resource being accessed. Reduces contention but increases complexity.
        * **Coarse-grained locks:** Lock larger portions. Simpler but can lead to higher contention and reduced parallelism.
    * **Duration:** Hold locks for the shortest possible time to minimize blocking other operations.
    * **Deadlocks:** A situation where two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever finishes.
* **Types of Locks:**
    * **Local Locks:** Mutexes, semaphores for resources within a single process.
    * **Distributed Locks:** For shared resources in a distributed system, requiring a coordinator or consensus mechanism (e.g., using ZooKeeper, Etcd, Redis with Redlock, or relying on database locks).
* **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC):**
    * **Alternative to Locking:** Assumes conflicts are rare.
    * **Mechanism:** Operations proceed without acquiring locks. Before committing changes, the system checks if the data has been modified by another concurrent operation. If a conflict is detected, the operation is retried.
    * **"Compare and Swap" (CAS):** A common atomic operation used in OCC. It compares the current value of a memory location with an expected value, and if they match, it updates the location with a new value.
    * **When to Use:** Suitable for systems with low contention or where read-heavy workloads dominate.
