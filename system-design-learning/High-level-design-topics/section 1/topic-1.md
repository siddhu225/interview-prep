### ‚öôÔ∏è **Types of System Design Interviews**

#### 1. **Product Design** (Most Common)

* Design systems behind real-world products.
* Ex: Chat App like Slack, Ride Sharing like Uber, Social Media like Facebook.

#### 2. **Infrastructure Design**

* Focused on low-level system components (e.g., rate limiters, brokers).
* Requires deep system knowledge (e.g., durability, consensus).
* Ex: Design a rate limiter, key-value store, message broker.

#### 3. **Object-Oriented Design (Low-Level Design)**

* Emphasizes class structures, SOLID principles.
* Common at Amazon and similar companies.
* Ex: Parking lot, vending machine, elevator system.
* *Not covered deeply in this guide.*

#### 4. **Frontend Design**
