Here are **detailed, interview-ready notes** on the **Prototype Design Pattern** in JavaScript ‚Äî perfect for quick revision and real-world understanding.

# ‚úÖ Prototype Design Pattern in JavaScript

## üîπ What is the Prototype Pattern?

The **Prototype Design Pattern** is a **creational pattern** that lets you **clone existing objects** instead of creating new instances from scratch. It‚Äôs useful when object creation is expensive, and you want to create copies of existing objects with the same configuration.

In JavaScript, this pattern is **natively supported** through **prototypes**, making it a natural fit.

---

## üîπ When to Use It

* When object creation is **costly** (e.g., deep configuration, database read).
* When you need to create **similar objects repeatedly**.
* When you want to avoid the overhead of initializing an object from scratch.

---

## üîπ Key Concepts

* **Prototype**: An original object to clone from.
* **Cloning**: Creating a copy of the original object.
* In JS, objects have an internal `[[Prototype]]`, which can be accessed using `Object.getPrototypeOf()` or `__proto__`.

---

## üîπ Simple Real-World Example

Imagine you're building a document editor that supports templates. You can clone a base template instead of building each document from scratch.

```js
const DocumentTemplate = {
  type: 'generic',
  header: 'Untitled Document',
  content: '',
  clone: function () {
    return Object.assign({}, this); // shallow clone
  }
};

const invoiceDoc = DocumentTemplate.clone();
invoiceDoc.type = 'invoice';
invoiceDoc.header = 'Invoice #001';

console.log(invoiceDoc);
// { type: 'invoice', header: 'Invoice #001', content: '', clone: [Function: clone] }

const reportDoc = DocumentTemplate.clone();
reportDoc.type = 'report';
reportDoc.header = 'Weekly Report';

console.log(reportDoc);
// { type: 'report', header: 'Weekly Report', content: '', clone: [Function: clone] }
```

üü¢ **Result**: You reused the original `DocumentTemplate` without rewriting the entire structure.

## üîπ Cloning with Prototypes in JavaScript

JavaScript allows you to clone and set the prototype using `Object.create()`:

```js
const CarPrototype = {
  init(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  },
  start() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} started`);
  }
};

// Create a new object using the prototype
const car1 = Object.create(CarPrototype);
car1.init('Toyota', 'Corolla');
car1.start(); // Toyota Corolla started

const car2 = Object.create(CarPrototype);
car2.init('Honda', 'Civic');
car2.start(); // Honda Civic started
```

### üî∏ Notes:

* `Object.create()` creates a **new object with the given prototype**.
* It's a clean way to implement prototypal inheritance and the Prototype pattern in JS.

---

## üîπ Deep Cloning

If your object has nested properties, use a deep clone utility:

```js
function deepClone(obj) {
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); // simple deep clone (loses methods)
}
```

üî¥ Note: This approach doesn't copy functions or circular references. For deep cloning complex objects (e.g., with methods), use libraries like `lodash` (`_.cloneDeep`).

---

## üîπ Benefits

* ‚úÖ Reduces code duplication.
* ‚úÖ Speeds up object creation.
* ‚úÖ Promotes reuse and consistency.

---

## üîπ Drawbacks

* ‚ùå Cloning complex objects can be tricky (deep vs shallow).
* ‚ùå Manual copying of functions/methods needed in some cases.

## üîπ Prototype Pattern vs Class Instantiation

| Aspect          | Prototype Pattern                     | Class-based Instantiation         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Object creation | Cloning from existing object          | Using `new` keyword               |
| Use case        | Similar objects with shared structure | Unique objects with custom logic  |
| Flexibility     | High                                  | Medium                            |
| Performance     | Better if cloning avoids costly setup | Slower if initialization is heavy |

---

## üß† Summary for Interviews

* The **Prototype Pattern** allows you to **clone** existing objects for quick object creation.
* In JavaScript, it's naturally supported via `Object.create()` and `Object.assign()`.
* Use it when:

  * You want **object templates** (like documents, cars, UI widgets).
  * You want to avoid repeated initialization logic.

## üìù Quick Revision Code Snippet

```js
const Shape = {
  type: 'generic',
  draw() {
    console.log(`Drawing a ${this.type} shape`);
  },
  clone() {
    return Object.assign({}, this);
  }
};

const circle = Shape.clone();
circle.type = 'circle';
circle.draw(); // Drawing a circle shape
```
