# üè≠ Factory Design Pattern in JavaScript ‚Äì Interview Notes

---

## ‚úÖ What is Factory Design Pattern?

The **Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** used to create objects **without specifying the exact class or constructor** that will be instantiated. Instead, a **factory function** handles the object creation logic.

This is useful when:

* You need to create many objects with shared structure but varying details.
* You want to **decouple object creation from usage**.
* You want a flexible and centralized object creation mechanism.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

* **Encapsulates object creation logic**
* Provides a **common interface** for creating objects
* **Abstracts complexity** involved in object instantiation
* Promotes **loose coupling**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

```plaintext
+-------------------+
|  Creator (Factory)|
+-------------------+
| + create(type)    |
+-------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
| Product (Object) |
+------------------+
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Example

Let‚Äôs implement a `CarFactory` that creates different types of cars.

```javascript
// Step 1: Define product constructors
class Sedan {
  constructor() {
    this.type = 'Sedan';
    this.doors = 4;
  }
}

class SUV {
  constructor() {
    this.type = 'SUV';
    this.doors = 5;
  }
}

// Step 2: Define the factory
class CarFactory {
  createCar(carType) {
    switch(carType) {
      case 'sedan':
        return new Sedan();
      case 'suv':
        return new SUV();
      default:
        throw new Error("Unknown car type");
    }
  }
}

// Step 3: Use the factory
const factory = new CarFactory();

const car1 = factory.createCar('sedan');
console.log(car1); // { type: 'Sedan', doors: 4 }

const car2 = factory.createCar('suv');
console.log(car2); // { type: 'SUV', doors: 5 }
```

## üß© Factory Function Alternative

In JavaScript, we often use factory **functions** instead of classes.

```javascript
function createUser(type) {
  const baseUser = {
    login() {
      console.log(`${this.role} logged in`);
    }
  };

  if (type === 'admin') {
    return Object.assign({}, baseUser, { role: 'Admin', access: 'Full' });
  } else if (type === 'guest') {
    return Object.assign({}, baseUser, { role: 'Guest', access: 'Limited' });
  } else {
    return Object.assign({}, baseUser, { role: 'User', access: 'Standard' });
  }
}

const admin = createUser('admin');
admin.login(); // Admin logged in

const guest = createUser('guest');
guest.login(); // Guest logged in
```

---

## üìö Real-World Use Cases

* **UI component creation**: Based on type or config
* **Logger factory**: Create different loggers (console, file, remote)
* **Database connectors**: Based on environment (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* **Game development**: Create enemy/character types based on level

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Centralizes object creation
* Increases flexibility and scalability
* Avoids repetitive `new` usage across the codebase
* Easy to introduce new types without changing client code

---

## ‚ùå Drawbacks

* Can introduce **complexity** if overused
* May lead to large factory classes/functions
* Not suitable when you only need simple object instantiation

---

## üîÅ Comparison With Constructor

| Aspect        | Factory Pattern       | Constructor/`new`        |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Abstraction   | Higher                | Lower                    |
| Flexibility   | More (conditional)    | Less                     |
| Extensibility | Easy to add types     | Harder                   |
| Inheritance   | Manual via prototypes | Native via class extends |

---

## üí° Best Practices

* Use **naming conventions**: e.g., `createUser`, `buildComponent`
* Combine with **strategy pattern** for dynamic behaviors
* Avoid making factory too bloated ‚Äî consider **multiple small factories**
* Prefer **composition over inheritance** inside factories

---

## üí¨ Interview Tip

Be ready to explain:

* **Why** factory pattern is useful in JavaScript
* **When** to choose factory over class constructors
* The **difference** between Factory Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern (advanced)
* Real-world analogy: Think of a coffee shop ‚Äì customers ask for a ‚ÄúLatte‚Äù or ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù without knowing how it's made internally.

## ‚úÖ What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that provides an **interface for creating families of related or dependent objects** **without specifying their concrete classes**.

> üß† It‚Äôs like a factory of factories ‚Äî where each factory creates objects that are part of the same family.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

* Used when the system needs to create **multiple related objects**
* Helps ensure **object compatibility**
* Promotes **loose coupling** between client code and object creation
* Built on top of the **Factory Method Pattern**

## üèóÔ∏è Structure Diagram

```plaintext
            Client
              |
       ----------------
       |              |
AbstractFactory    --> createProductA()
                    --> createProductB()
       |
ConcreteFactory1       ConcreteFactory2
   |                          |
 ProductA1, ProductB1     ProductA2, ProductB2
```

---

## üîß Real-World Analogy

ü™ë Imagine a **furniture factory**:

* VictorianFurnitureFactory creates: `VictorianChair`, `VictorianSofa`
* ModernFurnitureFactory creates: `ModernChair`, `ModernSofa`

The client can switch the entire **family of products** by changing the factory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Example in JavaScript

Let‚Äôs implement a **UI Theme Factory** with `LightThemeFactory` and `DarkThemeFactory`.

### Step 1: Define Product Interfaces

```javascript
// Product A
class Button {
  render() {}
}

// Product B
class Checkbox {
  render() {}
}
```

### Step 2: Concrete Product Implementations

```javascript
class LightButton extends Button {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering light button');
  }
}

class DarkButton extends Button {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering dark button');
  }
}

class LightCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering light checkbox');
  }
}

class DarkCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering dark checkbox');
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Abstract Factory Interface

```javascript
class UIThemeFactory {
  createButton() {}
  createCheckbox() {}
}
```

### Step 4: Concrete Factories

```javascript
class LightThemeFactory extends UIThemeFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new LightButton();
  }

  createCheckbox() {
    return new LightCheckbox();
  }
}

class DarkThemeFactory extends UIThemeFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new DarkButton();
  }

  createCheckbox() {
    return new DarkCheckbox();
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Client Code

```javascript
function renderUI(factory) {
  const button = factory.createButton();
  const checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();

  button.render();
  checkbox.render();
}

const lightFactory = new LightThemeFactory();
renderUI(lightFactory);
// Output:
// Rendering light button
// Rendering light checkbox

const darkFactory = new DarkThemeFactory();
renderUI(darkFactory);
// Output:
// Rendering dark button
// Rendering dark checkbox
```

## üß© When to Use Abstract Factory

‚úÖ When:

* You need to create **families of related objects**
* Your system should be **independent of how its products are created**
* You want to ensure **consistency** between components

üö´ Avoid if:

* You only need **one kind** of product
* You want **simple instantiation** without relationships between products

---

## üìö Real-World Use Cases

* UI frameworks with **themes** (e.g. Material vs Bootstrap)
* **Cross-platform support**: Windows vs Mac UI controls
* **Database drivers**: Switching between MySQL and PostgreSQL families
* **Game development**: Different levels/themes generating related enemies, weapons, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Enforces **consistency** across related objects
* Makes it easy to **switch product families**
* Helps follow the **Open/Closed Principle**
* Promotes **loose coupling** between client code and object instantiation

---

## ‚ùå Drawbacks

* Can add **complexity** due to multiple layers of abstraction
* Can result in **too many classes/interfaces**
* May be overkill for simple object creation

---

## üîÅ Factory vs Abstract Factory

| Feature           | Factory Pattern         | Abstract Factory Pattern            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Creates one object type | Creates related families of objects |
| Abstraction Level | Single product          | Multiple related products           |
| Example           | Create one type of car  | Create sedan + SUV as a family      |
| Flexibility       | Moderate                | High                                |
| Complexity        | Low                     | Moderate to high                    |

---

## üß™ Mini Quiz (Self-Check)

1. How is the Abstract Factory Pattern different from the Factory Pattern?
2. Why would you use an Abstract Factory in a UI component library?
3. Can Abstract Factory ensure consistency among related components?
4. What happens if you want to add a new product type (e.g. `Slider`)?
5. Can you use abstract factory pattern with functions instead of classes in JS?

---

## üí¨ Interview Tips

* Be ready to **differentiate Abstract Factory and Factory patterns**
* Show **understanding of product families** and consistency
* Use **theme, UI component, or game level** analogies to explain
* Mention **modularity** and **decoupling** in your reasoning
