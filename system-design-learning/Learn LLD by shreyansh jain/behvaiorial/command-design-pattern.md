Here's a detailed, interview-ready explanation of the **Command Design Pattern** in JavaScript â€” with examples, use cases, benefits, and a quick revision snippet for easy recall during interviews.

# âœ… Command Design Pattern in JavaScript

## ðŸ”¹ What is the Command Pattern?

The **Command Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that turns a **request or action into an object**. This allows you to:

* Parameterize methods with commands.
* Queue or log operations.
* Undo/redo operations.

It decouples the **sender** of a request from the **receiver**, making systems more flexible and extensible.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Real-world Analogy

Think of a **remote control**:

* Each button is a **command** (e.g., TurnOnTV, TurnOffTV).
* The remote (invoker) doesn't know how the device (receiver) works internallyâ€”it just sends commands.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Components

| Component           | Role                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command**         | Interface/base for all commands                   |
| **ConcreteCommand** | Implements the command's `execute()` and `undo()` |
| **Receiver**        | The actual object that performs the action        |
| **Invoker**         | Triggers the command                              |
| **Client**          | Sets up the command, receiver, and invoker        |

## ðŸ”¹ Example: TV Remote (Command Pattern in JS)

### 1. Receiver

```js
class TV {
  turnOn() {
    console.log("TV is ON");
  }

  turnOff() {
    console.log("TV is OFF");
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Command Interface + Concrete Commands

```js
class TurnOnCommand {
  constructor(tv) {
    this.tv = tv;
  }

  execute() {
    this.tv.turnOn();
  }

  undo() {
    this.tv.turnOff();
  }
}

class TurnOffCommand {
  constructor(tv) {
    this.tv = tv;
  }

  execute() {
    this.tv.turnOff();
  }

  undo() {
    this.tv.turnOn();
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Invoker

```js
class RemoteControl {
  setCommand(command) {
    this.command = command;
  }

  pressButton() {
    this.command.execute();
  }

  pressUndo() {
    this.command.undo();
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Client

```js
const tv = new TV();
const turnOn = new TurnOnCommand(tv);
const turnOff = new TurnOffCommand(tv);

const remote = new RemoteControl();

remote.setCommand(turnOn);
remote.pressButton();   // TV is ON

remote.pressUndo();     // TV is OFF

remote.setCommand(turnOff);
remote.pressButton();   // TV is OFF

remote.pressUndo();     // TV is ON
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of the Command Pattern

* âœ… Decouples **sender** and **receiver**.
* âœ… Supports **undo/redo** operations.
* âœ… Makes it easy to **queue commands**.
* âœ… Enables **macro commands** (batch execution).
* âœ… Improves **testability** and **logging** of operations.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases

* UI buttons triggering actions (e.g., copy/paste).
* Undo/redo functionality in apps.
* Task schedulers or queues.
* Macro commands in automation systems.
* Logging and auditing of executed actions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Variants / Enhancements

* **MacroCommand**: A command that executes multiple commands.
* **UndoableCommand**: Each command maintains the state required to undo it.
* **Command History**: A stack to manage undo/redo.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Command Pattern vs Strategy Pattern

| Aspect             | Command Pattern                | Strategy Pattern                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose            | Encapsulates **requests**      | Encapsulates **algorithms**         |
| Involves execution | Yes (`execute()`)              | No direct execution                 |
| Undoable?          | Yes, often supports undo       | No                                  |
| Example            | Button triggers a save command | Choose sorting algorithm at runtime |

## âœ… Quick Revision Snippet

```js
class Light {
  on() { console.log("Light ON"); }
  off() { console.log("Light OFF"); }
}

class LightOnCommand {
  constructor(light) { this.light = light; }
  execute() { this.light.on(); }
}

class LightOffCommand {
  constructor(light) { this.light = light; }
  execute() { this.light.off(); }
}

const light = new Light();
const onCommand = new LightOnCommand(light);
const offCommand = new LightOffCommand(light);

onCommand.execute();  // Light ON
offCommand.execute(); // Light OFF
```

## ðŸ§  Summary for Interviews

* The **Command Pattern** encapsulates actions into objects.
* Promotes **loose coupling**, **undo functionality**, and **flexibility**.
* Key parts: **Command**, **Receiver**, **Invoker**, **Client**.
* Common in GUIs, queues, scheduling, and undo/redo systems.
