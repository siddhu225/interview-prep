Absolutely! Let’s break down **Selection Sort** — starting with its explanation, followed by the algorithm, and then your code with revision-friendly comments.

## 🧠 What is **Selection Sort**?

**Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It works by **repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest)** element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the correct sorted position.

---

### ✅ **How it works:**

1. Start with the **first element** — assume it’s the **minimum**.
2. Traverse the rest of the array to **find the true minimum**.
3. Swap that minimum element with the first element.
4. Move to the next position and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.

### 📈 Time & Space Complexity:

| Case         | Time Complexity | Explanation                   |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n²)           | No early exit optimization    |
| Average Case | O(n²)           | Nested loops for each element |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)           | Same as average               |
| Space        | O(1)            | In-place sorting              |

### 📌 **Selection Sort Algorithm** (Ascending Order):

1. Loop `i` from `0` to `n - 2`:

   * Assume `arr[i]` is the minimum.
2. Loop `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`:

   * If `arr[j] < arr[min]`, update the `minIndex`.
3. After the inner loop, swap `arr[i]` with `arr[minIndex]` if needed.
4. Continue until the entire array is sorted.

### ✅ **Your Code with Detailed Comments**

```js
function selectionSort(arr) {
  // Outer loop: selects position to fill with the minimum value
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    let minIndex = i; // Assume current index has the minimum value
    let min = arr[i];

    // Inner loop: find the true minimum element in the unsorted part
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < min) {
        min = arr[j];       // Found new minimum
        minIndex = j;       // Update index of minimum
      }
    }

    // Swap if a smaller element was found
    if (minIndex !== i) {
      [arr[i], arr[minIndex]] = [arr[minIndex], arr[i]];
    }
  }

  return arr; // Return the sorted array
}
```

### 🧠 Quick Notes for Interview Revision

* ✅ **In-place sort** (no extra space used)
* ❌ **Not stable** (equal elements might change order)
* 🔁 Always performs `O(n²)` comparisons, even if already sorted
* ⚙️ Easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets
